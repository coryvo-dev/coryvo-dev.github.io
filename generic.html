									<h1>Headstarter AI<br />
									Fellowship</h1>
									<p>7-Week SWE fellowship. Each week consisted of an assigned group<br />
										project, speaker panels, and weekend hackathons.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/headstarter.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Week 1</h2>
									<dl>
										<dt>Day 1</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>To kickoff the start of the fellowship the renowned tech influencer and SWE Sajjad Khadar shared some incredible insights. What really stood out to me was 
												his emphasis on "passionate reporting." He focused in how important it was for him to find his passion and attributes a lot of his success to it. He urged
												for us to really find our niche in the world of computing to make sure we would have the drive to continually push. He also mentioned the rise of the "attention
												economy." If you can build a social media presence it can be instrumental in giving you a boost in the tech industry.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Day 2</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The following day we had ex-Google SWE and ex-CTO of Sandhill Markets, Jack O'Brien. He urged all early career fellows to just DO.
												As someone who is early on in there career, I struggle to start on personal projects since I deem my abilities as "not enough" to start. However, he claimed that
												you only learn by doing. He encouraged everyone to just start a project, no matter the scope, then let the learning come with the process. This message really resonated with
												me personally.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Day 3</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Then we had the funniest and most energetic speaker of the week, social media influencer Farzaan Aleem aka @lifewfarzy. His talk focused on building your confidence, social media presence,
												and ability to market yourself. You need to be able to sell yourself to employers on why 
												you are a good fit. Only then will you begin to be a serious candidate to get hired. He also emphasized building your presence on any social media platform. If you are able to garner attention, you 
												can leverage this success for tech roles.
											</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Day 4</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Finally, we capped off the week with a star studded panel!
												<h3>Panelists</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Dustin Beadle (Current Director of Lattice & ex-General Manager of AMD)</li>
													<li>Nabeel Alamgir (CEO of Lunchbox, Raised $100M VC)</li>
													<li>Logan Havern (CEO of Datalogz, Raised $12M)</li>
													<li>Shriar Kabir (CEO of Ruby Card - YCW23, ex-Salesforce & NFL SWE)</li>
													<li>Miguel Acero (CTO of Ruby Card - YCW23 ex-Google SWE)</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p>Throughout Dustin's career he has worked throughout the world. In his roles as General Manager and 
												Director, he was reponsible for the Asia-Pacific Operation. His responsibilites opened my eyes on different
												outcomes of careers in tech. As an aspiring traveler, I find the opportunity of going to different countries 
												for work so incredible. His role has made me more interested in tech opportunities abroad.
											</p>

											<p>Nabeel had an incredibly candid and straight forward message. He truly knows how tough the 
												tech industry was. He was rejected 72 times before someone was willing to invest in his company. However, he emphasized
												mental strength and persistence. He encouraged everyone to embrace failures and have a 
												go-getter mindset. He argues that while it is true the job market is tough, everyone needs to stop making excuses.
											</p>

											<p>Logan's story was one that was centered around perserverance. He had countless setbacks throughout his startup journey, but
												remained persistent. Only through his relentless pitching efforts was he able to finally see money coming in from investors.
											</p>

											<p>Shariar & Miguel both had comfortabe SWE jobs, but decided to pursue their startup. You need to always be willing to invest in yourself.
												They also provided insight on the person they look for when hiring. They stated that before anything, they want someone who is willing
												to put in the work. Even if their technical skills are not the best, they are willing to invest in a hardworker. Another thing I found so
												interesting is Shariar's time as a SWE for the NFL. It opened my eyes on the scope of computing. As a sports fan, I will now be sure to look 
												out for these opportunities as well.
											</p>
											<hr />
											<h2>MAIN TAKEAWAY</h2>
											<blockquote>Embrace failure. If anything rack up failures and rejections, they are incredible learning opportunities.
												Also, do not make excuses for why you should not start, just do.
